 - **08/12/2021 - Intigriti - Bug Bytes #150 â€“ CMS wordlists, Lesser known Python bugs & Containers learning path**
    + [webapp-wordlists](https://github.com/p0dalirius/webapp-wordlists), a repository of path and directory wordlists for many CMSs. Having this collection of endpoints is valuable for fingerprinting CMSs when testing Web apps. The Python scripts used to generate the wordlists are also included, so you can tweak them to generate wordlists for any missing CMS.

 - **19/11/2021 - GreHack 2021 - Optimizing Server Side Template Injection Payloads for jinja2**
    + In this talk, I present a general approach to solve this problem by exploring python modules and python objects to find paths to high value targets, such as the os module or built-in functions. I will then use this technique to create the shortest payloads to access the os module in Python's jinja2 template engine.

    + [pywhisker](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/pywhisker) is a Python equivalent of the original Whisker made by Elad Shamir and written in C#. This tool allows users to manipulate the msDS-KeyCredentialLink attribute of a target user/computer to obtain full control over that object. It's based on Impacket and on our Python equivalent of Michael Grafnetter's DSInternals called [PyDSInternals](https://github.com/p0dalirius/pydsinternals). This tool, along with Dirk-jan's PKINITtools allow for a complete primitive exploitation on UNIX-based systems only.

    + [smartbrute](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/smartbrute) is a smart password spraying and bruteforcing tool for Active Directory Domain Services. Supports NTML over SMB or LDAP as well as Kerberos pre-authentication bruteforcing. It can also intelligently bruteforce a domain to prevent user lockouts.
